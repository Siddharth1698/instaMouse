Like button for Instagram if you are using from PC

I'm a person who loves keybaords more than mouse ;)
So, while using Instagram on Laptop. It's bit difficulty to like others photo on Insta. 
To void these I made a small python script to Like(give heart) by clicking "h" button in keyboard. Also "p" for playing video 

Enjoy keyboarding :)
